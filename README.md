# Setup 
* In sum cases u must remake the dll (if needed)
* Change username in the script (where ever needed)
* `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy {Unrestricted or Bypass} -Scope CurrentUser`   
* Or use one of the bypasses like `type file.ps1 | poweshell.exe -no-profile` or what ever suites
* Add a automation process to disable tamper once uac been invoked (this can be done!!)  

# Usage
