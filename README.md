# Version not supported ??
* Make a ticket and list the windows version with the ticket, it will help me to work out a fix faster. 

# Compile Dll

* powershell (the .NET Framework SDK is needed for this.)
```
# Define the paths
$originalCsFilePath = "C:\path\to\CMSTPBypass.cs"      # Replace with the actual path
$newCsFilePath = "C:\path\to\sl0puacb.cs"               # Replace with the desired new path
$originalDllPath = "C:\output\directory\CMSTPBypass.dll"   # Replace with the actual path
$newDllPath = "C:\output\directory\sl0p.dll"             # Replace with the desired new path

# Rename the C# file
Rename-Item -Path $originalCsFilePath -NewName $newCsFilePath

# Rename the compiled DLL
Rename-Item -Path $originalDllPath -NewName $newDllPath
```
* You can do it also with the .ps1 or do it manual with the oneliner in there...!! (.NET Framework SDK is needed for this.)

# Setup 
* In sum cases u must remake the dll (if needed)
* Change username in the script (where ever needed)
* `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy {Unrestricted or Bypass} -Scope CurrentUser`   
* Or use one of the bypasses like `type file.ps1 | poweshell.exe -no-profile` or what ever suites
* Add a automation process to disable tamper once uac been invoked (this can be done!!)  

# Usage
* Download these files from either this repo directly if machine has inet capabilities. (Or download these files and serve them with python :D)
* Get the files on the system 
* cd to dir
* ./{File}.ps1

# Change log
