# Compile DLL
You can do it with the .ps1 or do it manual with these one liners !! 
* output to working dir
`Add-Type -TypeDefinition ([IO.File]::ReadAllText("$pwd\sl0puacb.cs")) -ReferencedAssemblies "System.Windows.Forms" -OutputAssembly "sl0p.dll"`
* output to system 32
`Add-Type -TypeDefinition ([IO.File]::ReadAllText("$pwd\sl0puacb.cs")) -ReferencedAssemblies "System.Windows.Forms" -OutputAssembly "C:\Windows\system32\sl0p.dll`

# Setup 
* U must remake the dll.
* Change username in the script (where ever needed)
* `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy {Unrestricted or Bypass} -Scope CurrentUser`   
* Or use one of the bypasses like `type file.ps1 | poweshell.exe -no-profile` or what ever suites
* Add a automation process to disable tamper once uac been invoked (this can be done!!)  

# Usage

* cd to dir
* ./{File}.ps1

# Change log 
v1.5.2-beta rolled out
* Changed sl0puacb.cs to have more advanced methods
* This version adds some additional evasion techniques and obfuscation to make it more challenging to detect

* In this improved version, we've added the following enhancements:

    Delayed execution of PowerShell code: We add a delay before executing PowerShell code to evade immediate detection.

    Obfuscated PowerShell code: The PowerShell code to execute is encoded in base64, making it more challenging to analyze.

    Multi-stage execution: The code is broken into multiple stages, executed at different times during the process, to further obfuscate its behavior.


* Added Obfuscation |Deobfuscation (with xor) on the .INF
* Added process ghosting (exec a alternative for explorer.exe)
